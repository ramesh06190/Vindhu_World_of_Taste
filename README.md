Project Cost Management
Screenshot of Cost Estimation of our project
 

Level of accuracy
We rounded the cost estimates to the nearest $1500.
The level of accuracy for activity cost and contingency funds is 88.89 percent.
Units of measure
      Cost estimation is done in US Dollars.
Organizational Procedures links:
We use the WBS as a framework to provide stability with estimates.

1.Control thresholds
Change requests that could potentially push the project budget above the initial cost estimate frequently come up during the programming process. These requests for changes could include further features, tweaks, or alterations to the initial scope of work. It is significant to remember that carrying out these adjustment requests can result in costs that are greater than originally anticipated.
Our company allows for a project budget deviation of up to 10% to account for such circumstances. This variation threshold acts as a cap on potential cost increases brought on by alterations made during programming. By establishing this cap, we take into account the fluid nature of projects and the potential for last-minute changes that could have an influence on the budget.


2.Reporting formats
A monthly project status report will be created to give a thorough breakdown of the project's costs. The spending management plan's recommended corrective measures will all be included in this report. It is an essential document for keeping tabs on the project's success and progress.
The configuration and frequency of the cost reports needed for the project are the main topics of this section of the report. It provides details on the precise plans and schedules for producing cost reports, which are crucial for determining how well the project is performing financially. Cost reports are essential tools for monitoring the project's development and assessing its success. To effectively communicate information about costs, selecting the right cost reporting formats is crucial.

3.Process Descriptions
The cost management processes are all described in documentation.
It should be noted that the paper includes cost estimation and budget determination.

Plan for Supports / Managing Risk

Quality Management Plan

Introduction:
A quality management plan (QMP) aids in directing the program manager (PM) and project team when carrying out quality control and assurance tasks for a project or program. The QMP is typically created by a contractor and reviewed by the client. The degree to which a project meets requirements is defined as its quality.
The QMP identifies the following key components:
•	Project Deliverables & Project Processes: The primary project deliverables and procedures are subject to quality control.
•	Deliverable Quality Standards: The "measures" used to assess whether a deliverable was successful are the quality standards. Depending on the type of information technology project, these standards may change.
•	Customer Satisfaction: The customer satisfaction criteria determine when each deliverable is finished and meets the customer's standards for acceptance. These standards are used to evaluate the deliverables.
•	Quality Control Activities: The quality control procedures that keep track of and confirm that the project deliverables follow planned standards of quality.
•	Process Quality Standards: The quality standards that serve as the "measures" for assessing whether project work processes are being maintained too.
•	Stakeholder Expectations: Stakeholder expectations identify when a project process meets the project stakeholders' expectations for efficiency. Considering and approving all project changes with a high potential for impact is one example.
•	Quality Assurance Activities: The quality control activities that keep track of and confirm the effectiveness of the management and production processes for the deliverables.

Quality Standards:
The following things should be maintained in accordance with the pertinent standards and methodologies:
•	The policies and procedures for risk management must be followed too in every part. Developers must follow a set of coding standards to perform their duties.
•	Maintaining standards for security, privacy, advancing the code, and other issues is crucial.


Metrics:
Measurements based on the nature of the defects:
S No	Defect Level	Defect Name	Measurements
1	High-Level Defects	Incorrect estimation, Failure to assign tasks to the most qualified person,
Planning errors	It is important to use more accurate project estimation techniques and allot enough time for project evaluation.

The project manager should have a thorough understanding of the team members' skills and abilities to assign tasks effectively.

To avoid unexpected difficulties after the planning phase, care must be taken.
2	Mid-Level Defects	Bugs and integration challenges	There will always be bugs in projects, so proper testing and quality assurance should be used.

When modules are combined and tested as a whole, a few issues could occur. As a result, the testing group needs to be sufficiently knowledgeable about the many modules.
3	Low-Level Defects	Screen Resolution, 
Hard-disk specifications	Though the poor screen resolution of the PCs may not be a serious issue, the work should theoretically be better if it is.

Problem Reporting and Corrective Action Process:
•	Any task or problem that doesn't meet the standards for quality should be reported. It is necessary to react quickly.
•	Should pick any tools relevant to quality that can help in quality.
•	There should be definitions of quality assurance and control.
•	Any issue should be addressed as soon as it is acceptable by senior officials, and team members and stakeholders should be updated.


Supplier Quality and Control:
•	All the data should be rendered quickly.
•	If there are more users using the application concurrently, there shouldn't be any bandwidth issues or crashes.
•	The user interface should be friendly. Users should have no trouble using it.
•	All the requirements for satisfaction and appearance should be met.


Metrics we use to Measure Quality
Customer Complaints and Returns: Constantly keeping an eye on customer issues is the only certain way to prevent them. The following numbers can be used to track customer-related issues:
•	Reject or return complaints after a certain amount of time.
•	Numbers resolved over a specific time frame.
•	Costs associated with warranties.
•	Average time to resolve customer complaints.
Delivery Metrics: There are two key metrics that need to be tracked.
•	On-time Delivery (OTD): The percentage of units delivered within the OTD window is used to calculate on-time delivery (OTD).
•	Perfect Order Metric (POM): The percentage of orders that arrive whole, on schedule, undamaged, and with the right invoice is known as the Perfect Order Metric (POM) or fill rate.

Staffing Management Plan

Introduction
A staffing management plan is an approach created to assist organizations in determining the workers they require at all levels and across all departments, and then assisting in their recruitment. Depending on the organization's structure, business model, and methods for completing projects and meeting deadlines, this plan should ideally address the organization's needs in a variety of ways.   
Ultimately, a staffing management plan or process is a document that details the various human resources needs that will be met for both staff management and employees. The plan is essentially a component of the project management plan that, by properly managing various teams to complete tasks effectively and efficiently, enables projects to be successful. A project management plan is made to outline precise target objectives and project deadlines for various tasks that your business may need to finish.
Our project's staffing management plan aids in the identification of all the various roles that are necessary to complete it. In this, we define various locations and their functions within the project. This will ensure that everyone involved in the project is aware of their specific responsibilities. To ensure the overall success of our daily operations, a staffing management plan that is tailored to business is essential.


Staffing Requirements
This project will require the following internal staff:
•	The project manager oversees coordinating team efforts and gathering requirements.
•	The project manager will delegate tasks to developers and create the backend.
•	Project developers will create the user interface and test the application.


Staff Assignments
•	Project Manager: Will be interacting with the entire team to learn the status of the work and clients to gather any requirements.
•	Project Lead: Will be responsible for taking charge of the team's daily scrums and will inform the manager of the work situation.
•	Team members: Will stay committed to the daily scrum and finish the tasks given to them. They will work together with the team lead. They are also in charge of recording all their work.
•	Client: Will have regular interactions with the manager and take part in meetings where they will clear up the doubts of the developing team.
Training, Rewards, and Reassignment
Training: At the beginning of the project, training sessions for the staff will be held. These training sessions will focus on the hard and soft skills that employees must have to collaborate with other team members, such as the programming languages that they must learn.
Rewards: Employees may receive rewards in the form of recognition, promotions, pay raises, or other benefits depending on how well their work is done.
Reassignment: Every time a portion of work is submitted, peer reviews are done. This review of an employee's work will be conducted by a person on the same level or by a superior. If the work is not up to the same level after the peer review, it will be given back to the employee with a change request.

Risk Mitigation Strategies

The project manager must take certain measures to reduce or eliminate the risks associated with the project. When carrying out a project, the project manager takes full responsibility for minimizing the likelihood of risks. Below are the common methods used to mitigate risks in many projects:
1.	Clearly define the requirements: It is crucial to establish the project goals and have a deep understanding of them. This clarity significantly helps mitigate risks related to misunderstandings and uncertainties.
2.	Assemble the right team: People involved in a project can bring different types of risks, often due to their availability and skills. Individuals lacking adequate skills may take longer to complete their tasks, leading to increased risk.
3.	Distribute the risk: Avoid placing the entire burden of risk on a single person or group. It is important to distribute the risk fairly among all stakeholders.
4.	Foster communication and active listening: Individuals who are not considered stakeholders can unintentionally increase project risks by taking actions without proper coordination. Effective communication and active listening can prevent such risks.
5.	Assess feasibility: Before proceeding with the full implementation, conduct feasibility reviews and utilize models to test ideas and solutions. This approach helps reduce project risks by using the initial stages as a testing ground to thoroughly evaluate concepts, strategies, and solutions.
6.	Thoroughly test everything: Testing plays a vital role in ensuring reasonable and minimal project risks. It helps identify and address issues that could potentially lead to project failure. Test all aspects of your plans, including execution, programming, and expectations. Test frequently and allocate more time than anticipated.
7.	Have contingency plans: Being prepared for unforeseen events is best achieved through backup plans. These can include:
•	Contingency funds
•	Float in the project schedule
•	Additional resources on standby
•	Options to divide the project into phases or reduce its scope.
Below is the table of strategies we are using in our project.

Plan for Procurement / Closing

Procurement Management Plan

This report's status has been structured in accordance with the fulfillment standard, needs documentation, joining understanding, risk section register, task plan, side interest cost evaluations, cost normal execution baselines, and progressed technique property.

Guidelines on Types of Contracts: 
•	Fixed price contracts: The buyer's risk exposure is limited by a fixed-price contract. This will have a small positive impact on the project budget, but it will have a big positive impact on the risk register. As the seller takes on the entire risk, they typically raise the price a little to reflect any potential risks. To win customers, vendors occasionally offer prices that are absurdly low. The problem with that is that if something goes wrong and all the risk is on the vendor's end, they won't make enough money from the deal to justify working on your project and they might even lose money doing so. If this happens, you should keep an eye out because they might start to relax the requirements or standards to gain some ground. For many project teams, the advantage of a fixed-price contract is that you'll know exactly how much it will cost you before you start the job.
•	Cost-reimbursable contracts: You must pay the vendor what the task costs under a cost-reimbursable contract. It frequently includes both direct and indirect costs and can be anything from supplies to machinery. Indirect costs will be a predetermined percentage instead of those giving you a copy of their power bills and asking you to chip in. The agreement will have a clause allowing them to ask for benefits above the cost of the initial outlay, either in the form of a fixed fee or another initial installment. Even though it's common, make sure you fully understand what you're agreeing to if your dealer suggests it.
•	Time and materials contracts: The vendor receive payment for the materials they purchased as well as a daily or hourly rate for their labor under time and materials contracts. The developers of the software will in this case charge on a time and materials basis. In this scenario, supplies are typically limited, and they bill at their daily rate for the time spent creating and testing the new product. They'll act essentially as if they were a paid member of your project team, and you'll have some control over what they do. They may ask you to sign timesheets as proof of the hours spent working on your program, or at the very least present their own timesheets for your approval along with the invoice.

Standard procurement documents or templates: 
For this project, different types of procurement documents are used.

•	Request for Proposal (RFI): RFI is used to request data on a range of areas from potential bidders. RFI can ask for information about bids, including financial accounts for the previous ten years, details about organizational practices, details about certifications, a client list, details about previous clients, case studies, and more. The main goal of an RFI is to select a small number of potential suppliers with whom to share an RFP or RFQ that contains the actual requirements after narrowing down a lengthy list of bids.
•	Request for Quotation (RFQ): RFPs are official documents that are used to request price quotes and explicitly lay out the requirements for specific purchases. An RFQ is used for routine purchases of hardware, commercial software, laptops, and other equipment. An RFQ is a much shorter document that only lists the items to be purchased and requests a quote, as opposed to an RFP. The seller will offer a price quote and other details in response to an RFQ.
•	Invitation for Bid (IFB): A letter sent to potential bidders encouraging them to participate in the bidding process is known as an official invitation to bid.
•	Contract or Agreement: A contract or agreement has been mutually agreed upon by the buyer and seller. An offer, an acceptance, and sufficient consideration for the buyer and the seller constitute a legally enforceable agreement. The finalized contract will contain the full statement of work (SOW), in addition to additional terms and conditions.
•	Seller Proposal: A thorough offer made in response to a buyer's request for a quote or a proposal is known as a seller's proposal. The proposal will have a number of different parts, such as an understanding of the customer's needs, recommended technical solutions, a recommended execution strategy, a price, a guarantee, etc.
    
Guidelines for creating procurement documents: 
A majority of procurement papers follow a common format. This is due to the fact that it streamlines and makes computerization of the documentation process possible.

•	Gathering Information: A prospective customer starts by looking for suppliers who can meet the product's requirements.
•	Supplier Contact: The customer requests quotes, offers, details, and a tender before deciding on a potential supplier. Direct communication with the manufacturer or use of marketing are both viable options for achieving this.
•	Background Review: The customer now reads reviews of the disputed goods or services, and they might even request samples or put them to the test. The discussion of options for size, accessibility, and customization comes next. The acquisition of goods or services is the goal of the contract.
•	Fulfillment: Delivery and shipping of the requested goods or services will take place in accordance with the terms of the signed contract. Payment has also been completed at this point, and additional training or product deployment may be made available.
•	Renewal: The product or service shall be redistributed following consumption or disposal and the termination of the Contract.
